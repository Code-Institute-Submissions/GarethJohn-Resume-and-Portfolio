# [**Gareth John – Professional Portfolio and Resume**](https://gazzaj.github.io/GarethJohn-Resume-and-Portfolio/)

The purpose of this website is to create an online presence for an individual (myself in this case) to highlight skills, experience, work history and to showcase projects to potential employers. This must be achieved in a visually appealing UX, which enables the user to easily navigate and locate the information irrespective of the device they are using (mobile first approach).
The ultimate aim is to assist the individual in securing future employment opportunities as a software developer, by showcasing acquired skills of the common technologies used and

## **UX**

My aim is to provide a simple yet intuitive user experience, which requires the minimum amount of scrolling to locate information. I see this as particularly important on mobile screens.

For this reason I had elected to 
- maintain a fixed menu bar at the top of the screen.
- limit the amount of detail in the Work History section 

### **User Stories**

1. **_As a_** job seeker, **_I need to_** promote my skills and experience in an efficient and visually appealing way; **_in order to_** increase my chances of being interviewed and ultimately employed.

1. **_As a_** Hiring Manager/HR, **_I need to_** quickly establish if the candidate has the required skills and experience; **_in order to_** recommend them to the business and select them for interview

1. **_As a_** Technical Manager, **_I need to_** determine technical proficiency and if the candidate has the skills and experience, I am looking for; **_in order to_** bring them into my team be confident they can add value

1. **_As a_** Recruiter, **_I need to_** quickly establish if the candidate has the required skills and experience; **_in order to_** increase my chances of successfully placing the candidate with my portfolio of clients.

#### **Strategy**  
As previously stated, the aim of this project is 3 fold:
 - To create an online presence
 - To highlight skills, and work experience 
 - To showcase projects  
 ... all with the aim of increasing the individuals employability

It is also important that potential employers, recruiters or clients can easily make contact with the individual. This is achieved through the use of:
- email links
- social media links
- contact form
 
My intention is to provide some basic general information on the landing page sufficient to generate some curiosity; then to  make the key information easily accessible through an intuitive and repeating UX design. The intention is to provide multiple routes top the skills, experience and work history as well as multiple links to the downloadable CV.
- Multiple links to Experience section from Landing page.
- Consice listing of skills
- Abridged version of work history
- Multiple links to a downloadable CV
- Portfolio page with Project summaries and links to the deployed pages

#### **Scope**  
I want to challenge myself to produce something I am proud to put my name on, without overextending myself and causing scope creep. I am conscious that I needed to keep the content within the scope of my current knowledge; this is critical if I encounter any issues during the build and need to troubleshoot on the fly. I am aiming for a decent Minimal Viable Product.
In the planning for the website I created preferred and alternate design options; preferred being the more achievable option.
I had originally planned to use an image carousel on the home page, and although I was able to get this to function on large screens it would become useless on mobile. Thus I opted for the current, simpler stacked configuration.

#### **Structure**  
I plan to maintain a common navbar and footer section throughout the website to create an intuitive UX.  
 - In the end, there was a deliberate change to the 'CONTACT'; section of the contact.html page. Given that this page will have all the necessary contact information on it I decided to change the footer section to an 'ABOUT ME' box, where the user is reminded of some of the candidates key skills (as opposed to repeating the contact information).

I liked the idea of splitting the information into two sections with 1/3 and 2/3 widths respectively as we had done in the UCD Resume Walkthrough project. I intend to recreate this basic structure without copying the code from that exercise.
I will use the left hand 1/3 to list the shorter strings of data which could be bulleted or short paragraphs and reserve the remaining 2/3 portion of the page for the bulk of the information like work history. 
 - I believe I have achieved this without directly copying the code. 

#### **Skeleton** 
The website will comprise four distinct pages navigable through the 'navbar' menu: 
- Home | Experience | Portfolio | Contact
The navbar will also incorporate a link to a downloadable version of my CV.

A Footer section will provide additional information with links to social media sites and email, and another download link for the CV. I have also included a copyright statement.

The original design concepts/wireframes for each gage can be viewed below:
- [Home Page](https://github.com/GazzaJ/GarethJohn-Resume-and-Portfolio/blob/master/readme-images/Landing%20Page%20Design.png)
  - [Alternate Home Page](https://github.com/GazzaJ/GarethJohn-Resume-and-Portfolio/blob/master/readme-images/Alternate%20Landing%20Page.png)
- [Experience Page](https://github.com/GazzaJ/GarethJohn-Resume-and-Portfolio/blob/master/readme-images/Preferred%20Experience%20Page.png)
  - [Alternate Experience Page](https://github.com/GazzaJ/GarethJohn-Resume-and-Portfolio/blob/master/readme-images/Alternate%20Experience%20Page.png)
- [Portfolio Page](https://github.com/GazzaJ/GarethJohn-Resume-and-Portfolio/blob/master/readme-images/Portfolio.png)
- [Contact Page](https://github.com/GazzaJ/GarethJohn-Resume-and-Portfolio/blob/master/readme-images/Contact.png) 

As mentioned in the Scope section I created multiple design concepts to reflect my different design ideas.

#### **Surface**

##### **Colour Scheme**
I had intended to use a darker colour scheme for this website. However as the build progressed it just didn't seem to suit; nor did it match the images I had selected. Of all aspects of this build I will freely admit this was the area I struggled with the most. After some trial and error I sought inspiration from two websites:
- [10 Gorgeous Color Schemes for Websites](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/10-gorgeous-color-schemes-for-websites?kw=&gclsrc=aw.ds&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2or8BRCNARIsAC_ppyaGHtDUv5oNSHP0th9gb8N6VBiGFAq-pYu1cFQFW5szceQETvoAnKgaAhwPEALw_wcB)
- [10 Trending 2020Website Color Schemes](https://www.quicksprout.com/trending-website-color-schemes/)

I decided on the "Scholar" colour scheme as it fitted the theme of the website and made some use of a darker blue, which had been my original intention. I had added the teal colour to provide another slightly brighter colour for contrast.
On reflection I am pleased with the result; it isn't too playful or childish, yet isn't cold and boring. The colours provide a decent amount of contrast.

I wanted the look and functionality of the hyperlinks to be intuitive so read a little about achieving the right asthetics
- [WebFX - Designing and styling hyperlinks](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/designing-hyperlinks-tips-and-best-practices/)

##### **Typography**  
The only issue with typography is narrowing my choice down to one or two fonts.
- I selected **_Michroma_** because it has a squarer profile, which appeals to me, is easy to read and looks professional.
- I complemented Michroma with the **_Cairo_** font after comparing various combinations on the Google Fonts page. The selection was primarily made on the basis of aesthetics and ease of reading. Maybe it's my age but some font's were just a bit cramped and thus difficult to read, if that makes sense?

##### **Imagery** 
Given the intended purpose of this site is to convey my skills, experience and work history I have limited the use of images, preferring to focus on these other aspects. However, I want the few images I use to convey my journey from working on oil rigs and not into coding websites; I have thus attempted to pick appropriate images.
  
The only section where I break this rule doesn't apply is the 'PORTFOLIO' page. I want to use images of the projects in an attempt to generate interest and hopefully lead to user interaction.
I have reused the image of the rig for the contact page as it represents teamwork and links well with the heading "_How can we work together?_"

______

## **Features**
What follows is a list of the main features incorporated into the website, and a short list of upgrades which could be applied once my knowledge of other technologies like JavaScript has increased.

### **Existing Features**
- This is a static website comprising four distinct pages, linked by the use of a navbar.
- Navbar – I have selected a bootstrap responsive navbar to achieve plug and play functionality. 
  - Despite having a logo I have chosen to retain the 'Home' link to reduce confusion (in case users don't intuitively know to click the logo to return to the Home page).
  - On smaller screen sizes the navbar collapses into a "burger" icon which is subsequently used to display/hide the menu items.
  - I elected to fix the navbar at the top of the screen to ensure the user could always achieve quick and easy navigation to any other page.
- An Experience page with links to individual company websites, which enables the user to discover more about some of the companies I have worked for.
  - Progress bars and Bullet point quickly convey important skills. 
  - An 'accordion' dominates the Work History section enabling the user to selectively expand each job role as they see fit to find out a little more about each role. This is critical to limiting the visible text and the height of the page for mobile users.
- A Portfolio page with Project 'Cards" linking to individual projects. Links have been disabled where appropriate. Placeholder cards are used to illustrate what the page could look like as the number of projects increases. The cards have an image and brief explanation of the project.
- A Contact page with a functioning google map iframe and a contact form (currently linked to the CI form dump)
- A footer section with Social Media and email links; as well as a link to a PDF of my CV.

### **Features Left to Implement**

- I would eventually like to complete the Contact form so it is connected to an email API (currently lacking the JavaScript skills).
- Depending on the number of projects which I reference on this site I may need to consider a different layout for the Portfolio Page.

## **Testing**

The philosophy I have used throughout this build is to build, review and test each part of the website as I progressed, relying heavily on Google Dev tools throughout for first pass testing.

- Repeatedly tested the 'navbar' links throughout development to ensure correct navigation.
- I used DevTools extensively during development, changing devices, to ensure the desired responsive behaviour was achieved.
  - This helped to highlight an issue I had with Divs and whitespace on the right hand side.
- Once roughly 50% complete I deployed the website to Git Pages and started viewing the output on several real devices:
  - Samsung Galaxy S9
  - Samsung Tab A
  - HP Laptop with attached monitor
- I tested the functionality of the 'accordion' feature on the Experience page on these devices to ensure aesthetics and functionality were maintained.
  - This helped me make some changes to maintain responsiveness. 
- Repeatedly tested all links to ensure they function and correctly open up the required sites in new browser tabs.
- Tested Social Media icon to ensure they also link to the correct sites and open in new browser tabs.
- I have tested email links to ensure they open up the default email application and insert the email address.
  - Works on Samsung S9 – opening Gmail
  - Laptop – opening Outlook
- Tested the contact form on the Contact page to ensure correct functionality. This was linked to the CI Form dump page so I could verify the data sent.
- Testing of the 'required' attribute which ensures all contact form field get filled in before the data can be sent.
- I have tested the email address entry on the Contact form to ensure correctly formatted email addresses can be entered _e.g_ [_name@something.com_](mailto:name@something.com)
- Accessibility Test
  - Highlighted potential issue with the choice text color on the navbar, hyperlinks and Copyright section
    - Navbar text changed to a darker colour
    - Hyperlink colour changed to a darker blue for increased contrast
    - Copyright text changed to a darker colour to provide contrast.


- HTML Validation
Each page has been checked and all errors have been corrected.
- CSS Validation
Returned several errors related to the use of vendor extensions. I have chosen to accept these errors based on the fact they increase compatibility. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52490004/what-are-all-of-these-w3c-css-validation-warnings-about)

- CSS Auto Prefixer
- Mobile Friendly
- Website speed test where it passed in all but Security
- Spelling checked by copying and pasting the text into word.
- I forwarded the link to the website to friends to view and provide feedback. This was initially done at about 75% complete and again once 100% complete.
- I submitted my site for a "Peer Code Review" in the Slack community on 19-Oct-20.

## **Bugs and Issues**

- Initially the collapsed Menu items would not appear and disappear when clicking the 'burger'.
  - The solution to this was found in the [Slack community](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C7J2ZAVHB/p1592942356085000?thread_ts=1592936056.080800&cid=C7J2ZAVHB); and was simply a case of relocating one of the bootstrap JS CDN links to the 'head'


- While building the navbar toggler, the menu items would only appear on the right.
  - The solution was provided on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47518911/boostrap-4-navbar-collapse-menu-right-align/50881393)


- My navbar had a small amount of whitespace on the right-hand side.
  - The solution to remove this was again found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48510609/remove-white-space-from-the-sides-and-top-of-my-navbar/48510687)


- When I initially created cards for my portfolio projects each one was sized dependent on the content, which was undesirable. I found a solution to ensure all cards were equal height here: [Codeply](https://www.codeply.com/go/jbcgzs2Nzq)  

- I used the code listed on this site to push the card button down to the bottom of the card. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48406628/bootstrap-align-button-to-the-bottom-of-card)

- Throughout the build I had an issue with there being whitespace down the right hand side of my pages. The issue wasn't immediately obvious, until I created boxes around every element; which highlighted some divs were wider than the remainder of the page.
 This was a useful method to visualise the interaction of all page elements. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46630191/white-space-on-right-side-of-page/46630298)

- I struggled to achieve fully responsive and fixed height images for my portfolio cards. In fact I'm not sure this is possible to achieve without changing aspect ratios so I resorted to the "image-fluid" class from [Bootstrap - images](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/images/). Equalising the image height might be something which I add to the "Features left to implement" section but realise there are compromises in play here.

## **Deployment**

### **GitHub Pages**
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

- Logging in to GitHub and locating the GitHub Repository
- Clicking the "Settings" Button in the menu tabs.
- Within the Settings page scrolling down until the "GitHub Pages" section was located.
- Under the "Source" heading there is a dropdown menu. The "Master Branch" was selected.
- The newly created website address is now displayed in the green box at the top of the Github Pages section.

- There is no difference between the developed version and that deployed on Git Hub Pages

### **Code Snippets**

- Bootstrap responsive navbar - [Bootstrap 4 - navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/)
- While building the navbar toggler, the menu items would only appear on the right.
  - The solution was provided on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47518911/boostrap-4-navbar-collapse-menu-right-align/50881393) 
- My navbar had a small amount of whitespace on the right-hand side.
  - The solution to remove this was again found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48510609/remove-white-space-from-the-sides-and-top-of-my-navbar/48510687) 
- **Progress bars**
The progress bars used in resume.html were taken from [Bootstrap 4 - Progress](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/progress/)
- **Accordion Feature**
I copied and subsequently adapted the accordion feature fromthe tutorial provided on this webpage[**font-awesome-accordion-arrow-css**](https://supfort.com/font-awesome-accordion-arrow-css)
  - The reason for not using the standard Bootstrap accordion was that I wanted to visually indicate there was additional content hidden within each role.
- The code to achieve better looking bullets was taken from [Fontawsome](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/styling/icons-in-a-list)
- The project cards were also adapted from [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/) code.

### **Acknowledgements**

- The idea for this project originally came from a basic Resume exercise to illustrate ordered and unorder I had worked on while using the Mimo app&#39; (https://getmimo.com/playgrounds/812454) prior to starting the Full Stack Software Development course at the Code Institute. I subsequently expanded the basic exercise to create an online resume.

- I'd like to thank my mentor Sinead O'Brian for her direct and honest feedback and helpful advice in the run up to, and during this project.

- Further inspiration came from the UCD-Resume project in the CI User Centric Frontend module. I particularly identified with the thirds concept for separating the content.

- I'd like to acknowledge the guidance we received in an MS-1 planning call with :-
  - Jim Morel
  - John Traas
  - Anthony O'Brien
  ... the information they presented was regarding preparation for MS-1 projects was invaluable and helped calm the nerves somewhat before heading into the milestone project.
- Thanks to everyone at the Code Institute for helping to make this such an enjoyable and rewarding experience.
- I would also like to thank Luke Walters-Leatherbarrow at Learning People who provided moral support through the initial few week of my transition into the Coding world.
